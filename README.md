📊 Mini Project – Descriptive Statistics in Python
This project is a practical exercise in descriptive statistics using Python. It involves analyzing real-world datasets in CSV format (e.g. COVID-19 data) and extracting meaningful statistical insights using tools such as:

Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)

Measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation)

Skewness and kurtosis

Quartiles and boxplots

🛠 Technologies used:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)

Jupyter Notebook / scripts

CSV data files (real COVID-19 data included)

📁 Structure:

Covid_Polska.py, Covid_Swiat.py: data analysis scripts

dddd.py: document generation with statistical summaries

Transformata_Fourier_a.py: Fourier analysis (additional exploration)

.csv files: data sources for analysis

💡 You can use this project as:
A template for statistical analysis in academic work

A demo of Python-based data analytics

A starting point for more advanced data science projects
